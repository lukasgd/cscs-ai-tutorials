"""intranet.py, the toy company intranet the LATS exercises search over.

Nordhelm Instruments AG is invented: no real company, person, supplier or system
appears anywhere in it. The agent is dropped at the portal with a question, may take
12 actions, and is scored by the token F1 of the one answer it submits.

    import intranet
    env = intranet.IntranetEnv()
    print(env.reset(0))                       # query 1, at the portal
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step("goto_site[people]")

Standard library only, so it runs offline with no API key.

WHAT THIS FILE IS
=================
The whole environment, in two layers.

  * A PURE ENGINE of module level functions: `initial_state`, `observe`,
    `legal_actions`, `parse_action`, `transition`, `token_f1`. `transition` never
    mutates its input and never looks at a clock or a random number, so the same
    (state, action) always gives the same result.
  * `IntranetEnv`, a thin stateful wrapper. `step` is one call into `transition`.

The split is what makes the tree search legal. A LATS node stores `env.get_state()`
and nothing else, re-visiting a node is `env.load_state(node.state)`, and neither
copies the corpus, which is immutable and shared. Browsing is read only: there is
nothing to undo, so restoring a state really does restore the situation.

THE CORPUS lives in five sibling modules, `corpus_people.py`, `corpus_facilities.py`,
`corpus_it.py`, `corpus_products.py`, `corpus_policies.py`, and is assembled here.
Those five files are the single source of the page text; nothing is duplicated in
this file. They have to sit beside this module.

The two shapes the five modules are allowed to use are both accepted:
`body` may be a list of display lines or one string with a newline between lines,
and a link target is always the string `"<site_key>/<page title>"`.

THE QUERY SET is ten two hop bridges, and the shape of hop 2 is the one thing about
it that must never be relaxed. A HOP 2 PAGE IS A TABLE KEYED BY THE ENTITY HOP 1
REVEALS, never a page that states a single answer. "Coffee lounges by building"
lists four buildings and four room codes; only the team directory says which
building the Vega team sits in. So landing on the answer page is necessary and NOT
sufficient, and the two signals a search runs on come apart: the navigation
heuristic can see perfectly well that this is the right page and still be wrong
about the answer. That gap is why the terminal reward carries information the
heuristic does not already have, which is the whole point of the exercise. Every
query therefore carries `key_entity` (what hop 1 reveals, which the question names
only indirectly) and `decoy_answers` (the other rows of the table, at least three,
each a real answer to a slightly different question). A reader who reaches the hop 2
page without doing hop 1 is choosing among `(answer,) + decoy_answers` and scores
about `1 / (1 + len(decoy_answers))`, which selfcheck.py measures.

THE STATE is nine JSON serializable keys and no object references, so two equal
states are the same situation and a search can use the state as a transposition
key. There is deliberately NO rendered observation in it: `observe(state)` derives
the whole text from those nine fields. Do not add one.

THE RULES four separate implementations have to agree on, all from DESIGN.md:

  * page indices are 0 based IN CODE and 1 based IN EVERYTHING THE AGENT READS
    ("Page 3 of 7", `follow[1]` opens `links[0]`);
  * an ILLEGAL ACTION COSTS A STEP. This is a knowing divergence from the sibling
    MiniWebShop environment, where illegal actions are free. Free illegal actions
    would let a policy propose an unbounded number of non advancing children and a
    simulation would never reach a terminal state. Here every action moves the
    episode toward its end, so every trajectory terminates within MAX_STEPS, which
    is what makes the simulation operation well defined;
  * `answer[...]` is never enumerated by `legal_actions`, because its payload is
    free text. That is the one place the branching factor is infinite, and it is
    exactly what the policy language model is for;
  * `goto_site` to the current site is accepted by `step` and not enumerated;
  * `next` on the last page is illegal rather than wrapping, so the page order is a
    line and not a cycle;
  * stepping a finished episode returns `(obs, 0.0, True, info)` with `steps`
    unchanged. It must never raise: a rollout that overruns cannot be allowed to
    crash a participant's loop.

REWARD is token F1 in [0,1], paid only by `answer[...]`, 0.0 otherwise and 0.0 on
truncation. It splits on non alphanumerics rather than deleting punctuation in
place, which is a deliberate departure from the SQuAD metric: it keeps "N-310" as
["n", "310"], so "room N-310" earns 0.800 instead of 0.000 and the value function
has a gradient to steer along. Do not "fix" it back to SQuAD. Note what partial
credit does and does not buy here: it rewards loose phrasing of the RIGHT row
("queue Eiche" 0.667, "at 07:20" 0.800) and never a wrong one, because no gold
shares a token with any decoy in its own table. Carelessness scores zero.

TRUNCATION at MAX_STEPS ends the episode at reward 0.0 with `truncated` True. That
is this environment's version of the paper's depth limit L (HotpotQA 7, WebShop 15).
The paper does not say what happens to a trajectory that exhausts L; this is an
implementation choice and the notebook should say so.

To change the budget, set `intranet.MAX_STEPS`. `transition` and `observe` read the
module global at call time, so everything follows, including the "of 12" the agent
reads. Every number pinned in NUMBERS.md assumes 12.

# here and resolved to indices, so re-ordering a corpus module cannot silently point
# a hop somewhere else.
#
# Read one query and the shape of all ten is clear. Q1 asks for the coffee lounge of
# "the building where the Vega team sits". The team directory (hop 1) says Building
# Nord and carries no room code; the lounge table (hop 2) maps four buildings to four
# room codes and carries no team. Neither page answers the question, and a reader who
# reaches the table without the directory picks one row in four.
#
# Three pairings are load bearing and must survive any later edit:
#   * Q1 and Q5 share a hop 1 page and read different rows of it, so finding the
#     bridge page is not finishing the job;
#   * Q3 and Q4 both bridge to a system name and both land in `it`, and they need
#     different tables there, so landing in the right site is not enough either;
#   * products / "Sensing elements and suppliers" is hop 1 for Q2 and Q7 and hop 2
#     for Q9. The same page is a stepping stone in one query and the destination in
#     another, which is the cleanest demonstration in the set that a page has no
#     intrinsic value: V(s) can only ever be a guess about the question in front of it.
